quick reverse image search told me the building was used as the base for the "Radiant Assembly of God" in the show

[This](https://www.atlasofwonders.com/2020/06/perry-mason-city-filming-locations.html) link told me that
the "Second Church of Christ Scientist" was used for filming, and a quick wikipedia search told me the name of the architect

```
CYBORG{Alfred Rosenheim}
