# Changelog

## 0.4.1 - 2022-07-07

Hotfix to change some release configurations.

## 0.4.0 - 2022-07-07

## Added

- The `Ctrl-L` keybinding has been added, which allows you to clear the buffer
  (like the clear command and the same keybinding on UNIX shells)

## Changed

- We are now using go modules internally instead of dep files. This means that
  the install method using `go get` has changed, and the `go install` command
  should be used instead.
- The Go module path has also been set to howl.moe/claws, providing a
  hosting-independent install path for the project.

### Fixed

- There were issues moving the arrow key at the end of the line in the command
  buffer (#18). This has been fixed.

## 0.3.2 — 2019-02-24

- Fix claws crashing on cmder

## 0.3.1 — 2018-08-12

### Fixed

- Fix `CLAWS_CONNECTION` always having the same value as `CLAWS_SESSION`

## 0.3.0 — 2018-03-04

### Added

- Message piping allows you to log messages that you receive and you send, or do any kind of preprocessing before being sent or being shown to you. You can check the README for more information.

### Changed

- We changed the JSON parsing library, so now we have more control over JSON formatting and we can keep the order of keys without sorting them alphabetically as we did before. We also collapse single-key arrays and objects so that they are on one line.
- Double-Esc does not work anymore to exit; it is encouraged to use Ctrl-C instead.

### Fixed

- Claws doesn't complain anymore when it can't find the config file. Mostly a quality-of-life change for new users.

## 0.2.0 — 2017-06-26

### Added

- Browse the log output by using your arrow keys, PgUp, PgDown, your mouse wheel and Home/End while in esc mode.
  - If you press one of the keys mentioned above, while in ESC mode the log will not autoscroll. To enable autoscroll again, simply press Ins to go in normal mode.

### Changed

- While in ESC mode, a cursor will be shown to indicate what the current scrolling position is.

## 0.1.0 — 2017-06-25

First official version of claws.

- ESC mode, through which you can do special actions by pressing ESC then a key.
- Ability to exit claws by pressing ESC in ESC mode.

- Timestamps in messages on the log output, toggleable with `t` in ESC mode.
- Insert/normal mode by pressing Ins, replace mode by pressing Ins in normal mode already.
- Ability to enter normal mode by pressing `i` in ESC mode.
- Ability to enter replace mode by pressing `R` in ESC mode.
- Connect to a WebSocket by passing a ws:// or wss:// URL as the first argument on the command line.
- Connect to a WebSocket by pressing `c` in ESC mode and then writing down the ws:// or wss:// URL.
- Quit a websocket connection by pressing `q` in ESC mode.
- Add welcome screen that is shown if no argument is passed on the command line.
